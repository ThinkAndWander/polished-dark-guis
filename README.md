## Versions
Porting is hard, especially for me (I don't have the esoteric knowledge yet, haha). I will try to maintain future versions depending on popularity.  

Versions:
- [Fabric] 1.20.1

## Contributing
I'm not sure I'll take new models/textures because it has to match. If you recommend any and I do think it matches my style (or lack thereof lol), I will include it with credit!
